WinRT OpenStreetMap Control
===========================

This project is a port of Martin Brenn's Silverlight implementation, which can be found at
[OSM MapViewer](https://bitbucket.org/mbrenn/osm-mapviewer)

This project is not intended for production use. Eg it doesn't cache tiles, has no OpenStreetMap attribution et cetera.
It started it's life as a porting exercise from Silverlight to WinRT.


Other .NET / C# implementations for OpenStreetMap include:

* [OsmSharp](http://osmsharp.codeplex.com/)
* [WPF Map Control using openstreetmap.org Data](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/87944/WPF-Map-Control-using-openstreetmap-org-Data)
* [DeepEarth](http://deepearth.codeplex.com/)
